# Message_Encode_Decode_Python
Encoding and  Decoding of Message in Python with Tkinter 

# The objective of this project is to encode and decode messages using a common key. This project will be built using the Tkinter and base64 library.

# In this project, users have to enter the message to encode or decode. Users have to select the mode to choose the encoding and decoding process. The same key must be used to process the encoding and decoding for the same message.

## Project Prerequisites

1. To build this project we will use basic concept of python, Tkinter, and base64 library.
2. Tkinter is a standard GUI python library
3. base64 module provides a function to encode the binary data to ASCII characters and decode that ASCII characters back to binary data.


## Project File Structure

These are the step to build message encode â€“ decode python project
Step1: Import module
Step2: Create display window
Step3: Define function
Step4: Define labels and buttons
Step5: So this is what we will do in this python project.
